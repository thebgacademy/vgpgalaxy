# Assembling Genomes with the VGP-Galaxy Pipeline

This session is part of [**Biodiversity Genomics Academy 2023**](https://BGA23.org)

## Session Leader(s)

Delphine Lariviere  
Galaxy Team, Nekrutenko Lab,  
The Pennsylvania State University

## Description

This session will start with a short overview of the data used in the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP), and the pipeline developed by the collaboration VGP-Galaxy for the production of high-quality genome assembly. It will be followed but a hands-on assembly on real data in Galaxy. 
By the end of this session, you will be able to: 

1. Perform a genome Assembly in Galaxy
2. Evaluate the quality of your genome

## **[Slides](BGA23_slides.pdf)**

## Prerequisites

1. Understand the terms genome assembly, reads, contigs, phasing, haplotype, k-mers
2. Knowledge of genome assembly steps: contigging, scaffolding, QC
3. Create a user account on usegalaxy.org
